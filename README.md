# IoT Workshop Device

Code to be deployed on an IoT Device running Windows 10 IoT Core, supporting the IoT Workshop held at the Microsoft Detroit MTC in 2018.

Heavily influenced by the [work of @tbaggs](https://github.com/tbaggs/IoTCamp) for previous IoT Workshops.

Note: this code has not been hardened for production, it is intended for demo/training use only.
